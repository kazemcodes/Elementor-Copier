# üîß Fix: Service Worker Sleep Issue

## Root Cause Identified
The background service worker (Manifest V3) goes to sleep after 30 seconds of inactivity. When the copy operation is triggered, the message is sent to an inactive service worker, and the callback is never invoked.

## Evidence
```
‚úÖ [Copy] About to call chrome.runtime.sendMessage
‚ùå NO "[Copy] Response callback invoked"
‚ùå NO background script logs
```

The message is sent, but no response is received because the service worker is asleep.

## Solution Implemented
Added a "ping" mechanism to wake up the service worker before sending the copy request:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. content-v2.js
- Added a ping message before the copy request
- The ping wakes up the service worker
- After ping response, sends the actual copy request

#### 2. background.js  
- Added a ping handler that responds immediately
- This ensures the service worker is awake and ready

## How It Works:
```
1. User clicks element
2. Content script sends "ping" message
3. Service worker wakes up (if asleep)
4. Service worker responds to ping
5. Content script sends "copyToClipboard" message
6. Service worker processes copy request
7. Clipboard write happens
8. Success notification appears
```

## Next Steps:
1. **Reload the extension** at `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Refresh the test page**
3. **Click a section** - you should now see:
   - `[Copy] Waking up service worker...`
   - `[Copy] Service worker ping response: {success: true, message: 'pong'}`
   - `[Copy] About to call chrome.runtime.sendMessage for copy`
   - `[Copy] Response callback invoked`
   - `‚úì Copied to clipboard`
   - Success notification appears!

## Alternative Solutions (if this doesn't work):
1. Keep service worker alive with periodic pings
2. Use chrome.alarms API to keep worker active
3. Implement a fallback to direct clipboard API
