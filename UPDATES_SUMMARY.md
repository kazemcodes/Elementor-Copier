# Updates Summary - GitHub Distribution

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Chrome Web Store References

**Deleted Files:**
- `CHROME_WEB_STORE.md` - Complete Chrome Web Store submission guide

**Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Removed Chrome Web Store badge, updated installation instructions
- `chrome-extension/README.md` - Updated build instructions for GitHub distribution
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Removed "Chrome Web Store" option, simplified to GitHub-only
- `BUILD_GUIDE.md` - Changed references from "Chrome Web Store" to "GitHub Release"
- `build-extension.ps1` - Updated success message
- `verify-release.ps1` - Updated success message

### 2. Created GitHub Actions Workflow

**New File:** `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`

**Features:**
- Automatically triggers on push to `main` branch when `chrome-extension/` files change
- Reads version from `manifest.json`
- Checks if release already exists (prevents duplicates)
- Builds extension using `build-extension.ps1`
- Creates GitHub release with:
  - Tag: `v{version}`
  - Title: `Elementor Copier v{version}`
  - Installation instructions in release notes
  - Attached ZIP file
  - Bitcoin donation address

**Workflow Behavior:**
- Only creates release if version doesn't already exist
- Skips build if release exists
- Runs on Windows (required for PowerShell script)
- Can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
