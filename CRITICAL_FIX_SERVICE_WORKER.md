# üî• CRITICAL FIX: Service Worker Crash

## The REAL Root Cause
The service worker was **crashing on startup** due to a module/script type mismatch!

### Error:
```
Service worker registration failed. Status code: 15
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'importScripts' on 'WorkerGlobalScope': 
Module scripts don't support importScripts().
```

### The Problem:
- **manifest.json** declared: `"type": "module"` (ES6 modules)
- **background.js** used: `importScripts('donation-manager.js')` (classic script syntax)
- These are **incompatible** - you can't use `importScripts()` in module scripts

### Why This Caused All Our Issues:
1. Service worker crashed immediately on load
2. No message handlers were registered
3. All `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` calls failed silently
4. Callbacks were never invoked
5. Copy operation never completed

## The Fix
**Removed `"type": "module"` from manifest.json**

Changed from:
```json
"background": {
  "service_worker": "background.js",
  "type": "module"  ‚Üê REMOVED THIS
}
```

To:
```json
"background": {
  "service_worker": "background.js"
}
```

This allows `importScripts()` to work correctly.

## Why This Works:
- Without `"type": "module"`, the service worker runs as a classic script
- Classic scripts support `importScripts()`
- The donation-manager.js loads correctly
- Message handlers register properly
- Copy operations work!

## Combined Solution:
We now have **TWO layers of reliability**:

### Layer 1: Direct Clipboard API (Primary)
- Fast, direct clipboard access from content script
- No service worker dependency
- Works even if background script has issues

### Layer 2: Background Script (Fallback)
- Now properly loads without crashing
- Handles cases where Clipboard API is restricted
- Uses offscreen document for clipboard access

## Next Steps:
1. **Reload the extension** at `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Check service worker status** - should show "active" not "crashed"
3. **Refresh test page**
4. **Click a section** - should copy successfully!

## Expected Logs:
```
[Copy] Using direct Clipboard API
‚úì Copied to clipboard via Clipboard API
[Clipboard Verify] ‚úì Valid JSON, type: elementor-copier
```

**Success notification should appear!**
