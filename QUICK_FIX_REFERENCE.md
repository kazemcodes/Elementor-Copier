# Quick Fix Reference

## What Was Wrong

1. **GitHub Actions 403 Error** - Workflow couldn't create releases
2. **Wrong Repository URLs** - All links pointed to old repo name

## What Was Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Permissions âœ…

**File**: `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`

**Added**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

**Why**: Gives workflow permission to create releases and upload files.

### 2. Repository URLs âœ…

**Changed**: `kazemcodes/elementor-copy` â†’ `kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier`

**Files Updated**: 12 files total
- All documentation
- Extension manifest
- Popup links
- Donation links
- Workflow files

## Test It Now

### 1. Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions and update repository URLs"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Watch Workflow
- Go to: https://github.com/kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier/actions
- Click on running workflow
- Should complete successfully âœ…

### 3. Check Release
- Go to: https://github.com/kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier/releases
- Should see v1.1.0 release with ZIP file âœ…

## If It Still Fails

### Check Repository Settings
1. Go to: Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Find "Workflow permissions"
3. Select "Read and write permissions"
4. Click Save

### Then Try Again
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
# Go to Actions â†’ Build and Release Extension â†’ Run workflow
```

## Quick Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is correct:

```bash
# Check for old URLs (should return nothing)
grep -r "elementor-copy" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=releases

# Check workflow has permissions
grep -A 2 "permissions:" .github/workflows/build-and-release.yml

# Check manifest URL
grep "homepage_url" chrome-extension/manifest.json
```

## Expected Results

âœ… No old URLs found
âœ… Workflow has `contents: write`
âœ… Manifest points to `Elementor-Copier`
