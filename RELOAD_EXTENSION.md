# üîÑ RELOAD THE CHROME EXTENSION

The code changes have been made, but you need to reload the extension for them to take effect.

## Steps to Reload:

1. **Open Chrome Extensions page:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - OR click the puzzle icon in Chrome toolbar ‚Üí "Manage Extensions"

2. **Find "Elementor Copier" extension**

3. **Click the reload/refresh icon** (circular arrow) on the extension card

4. **Refresh the webpage** where you're testing (the Elementor page)

5. **Try clicking a section again** - you should now see the new debug logs:
   - `[CopySection] Function called`
   - `[CopySection] Section element found`
   - `[CopySection] Data extracted`
   - `[CopySection] About to extract media URLs`
   - `[CopySection] Media extracted`
   - `[CopySection] Before processClipboardData`
   - `[CopySection] After processClipboardData`
   - `[CopySection] About to call copyToClipboardWithRetry`
   - `[Copy] Sending copy request to background script...`

## What to Look For:

The logs will tell us exactly where the code is stopping. If you see:
- ‚úÖ All logs up to "About to call copyToClipboardWithRetry" ‚Üí The issue is in `copyToClipboardWithRetry`
- ‚ùå Logs stop at "Before processClipboardData" ‚Üí The issue is in `processClipboardData`
- ‚ùå No `[CopySection]` logs at all ‚Üí The function isn't being called (different issue)

## Current Issue:

Right now, the extraction completes successfully but the clipboard copy never happens. The new logs will help us pinpoint exactly where the code flow breaks.
