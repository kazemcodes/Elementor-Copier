## Notes

The implementation was found to be already complete in the codebase. The verification process confirmed that all requirements were properly implemented in the `paste-interceptor.js` file. The version compatibility checks are fully integrated into the paste flow and work as expected.

Key implementation highlights:
1. Version detection uses `editorInjector.getElementorVersion()`
2. Compatibility checking uses `versionCompatibility.isCompatible()`
3. Conversion rules applied via `versionCompatibility.convertVersion()`
4. Notifications displayed via `showVersionNotification()`
5. All operations include proper error handling
6. Paste operation continues even if version checks fail

The implementation is robust, well-tested, and ready for production use.
