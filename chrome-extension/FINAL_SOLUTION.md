# Final Solution - CSP Issue

## The Problem

We've discovered the root cause:

1. ✅ The extension IS loading (we see v2.0 messages)
2. ✅ The module scripts ARE executing (we see export logs)
3. ❌ BUT Content Security Policy blocks inline scripts
4. ❌ AND content scripts run in isolated context, can't access page's `window`

## The Real Issue

The modules export to `window` in the PAGE context, but the content script runs in an ISOLATED context. They can't see each other's `window` objects.

## The Solution

We have two options:

### Option 1: Use Manifest V3's `world: "MAIN"` (Recommended)
This makes the content script run in the page context directly.

**Pros:**
- Direct access to page variables
- No CSP issues
- Simpler code

**Cons:**
- Can't use `chrome.*` APIs directly
- Need message passing for extension APIs

### Option 2: Message Passing Bridge
Keep isolated context but use `postMessage` to communicate with page scripts.

**Pros:**
- Maintains security isolation
- Can use chrome APIs

**Cons:**
- More complex
- Requires bridge code

## Recommended Fix

Since the paste functionality needs direct access to Elementor's APIs (`elementor`, `$e`), **Option 1 is better**.

However, Manifest V3's `world: "MAIN"` is only available in Chrome 111+. For broader compatibility, we need a hybrid approach.

## Hybrid Solution

1. Keep content script in ISOLATED world for chrome API access
2. Inject a bridge script into MAIN world
3. Use postMessage for communication

This is what the current code attempts, but CSP blocks it.

## Immediate Workaround

Since CSP blocks inline scripts, we need to:
1. Load modules as regular scripts (already working)
2. Create a bridge file that runs in MAIN world
3. Use that bridge to access Elementor

Let me create this bridge file...
