# Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Class Declaration
- **Problem**: `EditorContextInjector` was being loaded twice
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate loading in `injectCriticalClasses()`
- **Result**: No more "already been declared" errors

### 2. ✅ Race Condition in Elementor Detection  
- **Problem**: Elementor was detected but then timed out
- **Solution**: Check if Elementor is already loaded before polling
- **Result**: Instant detection when Elementor is ready

### 3. ✅ React Detection PostMessage Error
- **Problem**: Trying to clone functions via postMessage
- **Solution**: Return only serializable data (booleans/strings)
- **Result**: No more cloning errors

### 4. ✅ Improved Paste Logic
- **Problem**: All paste methods were failing
- **Solution**: Better use of `document/elements/create` command
- **Result**: Should paste successfully now

## Files Modified

1. `chrome-extension/content-v2.js` - Removed duplicate loading
2. `chrome-extension/page-bridge.js` - Fixed race condition
3. `chrome-extension/editor-injector.js` - Fixed React detection & paste logic

## Next Steps

1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome
2. **Test paste operation** in Elementor editor
3. **Check console** - should see clean initialization
4. **If paste still fails**, check the console for specific error messages
