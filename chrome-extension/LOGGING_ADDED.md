# Enhanced Logging Added

## Summary
Added comprehensive logging throughout the copy-paste pipeline to diagnose why elements aren't appearing correctly after paste.

## Files Modified

### 1. `content-v2.js` - Copy Operation
- Added detailed logging in `extractElementData()` function
- Logs element type, ID, settings, and child elements
- Shows extraction progress for each child element

### 2. `elementor-format-converter.js` - Format Conversion
- Added logging before/after conversion
- Shows input/output data structures
- Tracks children count through conversion
- Logs sanitization process

### 3. `paste-interceptor.js` - Paste Preparation
- Added logging before injection
- Shows complete data structure being sent
- Displays element type and array status

### 4. `editor-injector.js` - Elementor Injection
- Most comprehensive logging added
- Shows complete paste operation flow
- Logs container detection
- Tracks element creation
- Checks if element appears in DOM

## How to Use

1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome
2. **Open console** (F12)
3. **Copy a section** from any Elementor page
4. **Paste in editor** (Ctrl+V)
5. **Review logs** in this order:
   - `[Extract]` - What was copied
   - `[FormatConverter]` - How it was converted  
   - `[Paste Interceptor]` - What's being injected
   - `[ElementorCopier]` - How Elementor handles it

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs
```
[Extract] Found 2 child elements
[FormatConverter] Input children count: 2
[FormatConverter] Converted children count: 2
[ElementorCopier] Child elements count: 2
[ElementorCopier] Element in DOM check: true
```

### ❌ Problem Signs
```
[Extract] Found 0 child elements  ← Empty section!
[FormatConverter] Input children count: 0  ← No content!
[ElementorCopier] Element in DOM check: false  ← Not rendered!
```

## Common Issues to Diagnose

1. **Empty sections** - Check if children are extracted (`[Extract] Found X child elements`)
2. **Wrong element type** - Check element type in all stages
3. **Missing settings** - Check if settings are parsed correctly
4. **Not in DOM** - Check DOM verification at end of injection

## Next Steps

After collecting logs, we can identify exactly where the data is lost:
- During extraction (copy)
- During conversion (format)
- During injection (paste)
- During rendering (Elementor)

Share the console logs and we'll pinpoint the exact issue!
