# Console Errors Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Class Declaration
**Error**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'EditorContextInjector' has already been declared`

**Root Cause**: The `injectCriticalClasses()` function was trying to load `editor-injector.js` again, but it's already loaded via `manifest.json` in the MAIN world.

**Fix**: Removed duplicate loading - modules are now only loaded once via manifest:
```javascript
// Before: Tried to inject editor-injector.js dynamically
// After: Rely on manifest.json loading (MAIN world)
function injectCriticalClasses() {
  console.log('[Inline] Modules loaded via manifest (MAIN world), no injection needed');
}
```

**File**: `chrome-extension/content-v2.js` (lines ~47-51)

### 2. Race Condition in Elementor Detection
**Error**: Bridge detects Elementor at line 35 but times out at line 48 saying "not detected after 10s"

**Root Cause**: The `waitForElementor()` function wasn't checking if Elementor was already loaded before starting the polling loop, causing it to miss the already-loaded instance.

**Fix**: Added immediate check before polling:
```javascript
// Check immediately first
if (typeof elementor !== 'undefined' && elementor.config) {
  console.log('[Bridge] Elementor already loaded...');
  resolve(true);
  return;
}
```

**File**: `chrome-extension/page-bridge.js` (lines ~28-60)

### 3. React Detection PostMessage Error
**Error**: `Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Window': function l(e,t,n){...} could not be cloned`

**Root Cause**: The `detectReactComponents()` function was trying to send React/ReactDOM objects (which contain functions) through postMessage, but functions cannot be cloned.

**Fix**: Changed to return only serializable data:
```javascript
// Return serializable data only (no functions)
return {
  hasReact: hasReact,  // boolean, not the React object
  elementorVersion: elementorVersion,
  isReactBased: hasReact && parseFloat(elementorVersion) >= 3.0
};
```

**File**: `chrome-extension/editor-injector.js` (lines ~180-195)

---

### 4. Paste Methods Failing
**Error**: `All paste methods failed` when trying to paste Elementor content

**Root Cause**: The paste logic wasn't properly using Elementor's `document/elements/create` command, which is the primary method in Elementor 3.x.

**Fix**: Improved paste logic with better container detection and proper command usage:
```javascript
// Use document/elements/create as primary method
window.$e.run('document/elements/create', {
  model: element,
  container: container,
  options: {}
});
```

**File**: `chrome-extension/editor-injector.js` (lines ~238-320)

## Testing

After applying these fixes, you should see:

1. ✅ No CSP violations in console
2. ✅ Elementor detected immediately without timeout
3. ✅ React detection completes without postMessage errors
4. ✅ Paste system initializes successfully

## Expected Console Output

```
[Bridge] Page bridge script loaded in MAIN world
[Bridge] All modules available
[Bridge] Modules ready, waiting for Elementor...
[Bridge] Elementor already loaded, version: 3.28.0
[Bridge] Initializing paste system...
[EditorInjector] Message bridge initialized
[Bridge] In Elementor editor, initializing paste interceptor...
[Paste Interceptor] Initializing in Elementor editor...
✓ Keyboard paste listeners attached
✓ Editor iframe paste listeners attached
✓ Paste interceptor initialized
[Bridge] ✅ Paste system initialized successfully!
```

## Remaining Issues

The jQuery error at the end (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`) is from Elementor's own code, not the extension. This is unrelated to the extension functionality.
