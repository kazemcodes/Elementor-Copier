# üîç Critical Discovery - Why Settings Are Empty

## The Issue

You're copying from the **published frontend page**, but Elementor only stores settings in the **editor**!

## Evidence from Logs

```
‚úÖ Section has settings:
[Extract] Settings attribute found: {"background_background":"classic"}

‚ùå Widgets have NO settings:
[Extract] No settings attribute found (checked data-settings and data-elementor-settings)
```

## Why?

**Frontend HTML** (what you see on the published page):
- Only contains rendered output (images, text, HTML)
- NO configuration data
- NO styling information
- NO widget settings

**Editor HTML** (Elementor editor interface):
- Contains ALL settings in `data-settings` attribute
- Has complete configuration
- Includes styling, animations, everything

## The Fix Applied

Added content extraction from rendered HTML:
- Extract `<img>` tags for image widgets
- Extract text content for heading/text widgets
- Extract links for button widgets
- Store rendered HTML as fallback

## Test Now

**Reload and copy again.** You should see:
```
[Extract] Extracting widget content from rendered HTML...
[Extract] Widget type from attribute: image.default
[Extract] Rendered content extracted: <img src="...">
[Extract] Image widget - extracted image URL: https://...
```

## The Real Solution

### For Best Results:
1. **Open the page in Elementor editor** (not frontend)
2. **Copy from the editor interface**
3. All settings will be preserved!

### Or Use This Extension On:
- Elementor editor pages (best)
- Pages with `data-settings` attributes
- Your own sites where you have editor access

### Current Limitation:
- Copying from frontend = basic content only
- Copying from editor = complete with styling

The extension now extracts what it can from frontend, but for full fidelity, use it in the Elementor editor! üéØ
