# Solution: Paste Function Not Working

## Root Cause
The module files (`elementor-editor-detector.js` and `editor-injector.js`) are loading but their code is not executing due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions on the WordPress page. The classes are not being exposed to the `window` object.

## The Fix

Since external scripts can't execute in the page context due to CSP, we need to inject the code directly as inline scripts. However, Chrome is aggressively caching the content.js file.

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Completely Remove and Reinstall Extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browser
2. Find "Elementor Copier"
3. Click **"Remove"** button (completely uninstall)
4. Close ALL tabs with WordPress/Elementor sites
5. Click **"Load unpacked"**
6. Select your `chrome-extension` folder
7. Verify the extension appears with no errors

### Step 2: Verify the Fix is Loaded

1. Open a NEW tab (don't reuse old tabs)
2. Go to your WordPress Elementor editor page
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for these messages in order:
   ```
   [DEBUG-0] Content script starting...
   [DEBUG-1] About to inject critical classes...
   [Inline] Injection script added to HEAD
   [Inline] Script element in DOM: true
   [Inline] Script executing in page context...
   [Inline] ElementorEditorDetector injected
   [Inline] EditorContextInjector injected
   [Inline] Critical classes ready
   [DEBUG-2] Injection function called
   [DEBUG-3] After injection, loading modules...
   Elementor Copier: Content script loaded
   ```

5. If you see these messages, the fix is working!

### Step 3: Test the Paste Function

1. Go to ANY Elementor website (can be a demo site)
2. Right-click on a widget
3. Select "Copy Widget"
4. You should see a success message
5. Go to YOUR WordPress Elementor editor
6. Click on a section or column
7. Press **Ctrl+V** (or Cmd+V on Mac)
8. The widget should appear!

### Step 4: Verify Module Loading

Run this in the console after the page loads:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Module Status:', {
    ElementorEditorDetector: typeof window.ElementorEditorDetector,
    ClipboardManager: typeof window.ClipboardManager,
    PasteInterceptor: typeof window.PasteInterceptor,
    EditorContextInjector: typeof window.EditorContextInjector,
    instances: window.__elementorCopierInstances
  });
}, 3000);
```

Expected output:
```javascript
{
  ElementorEditorDetector: 'function',  // ✅ Should be 'function'
  ClipboardManager: 'function',         // ✅ Should be 'function'
  PasteInterceptor: 'function',         // ✅ Should be 'function'
  EditorContextInjector: 'function',    // ✅ Should be 'function'
  instances: {...}                       // ✅ Should be an object
}
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Clear Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Check for Errors
Look for these specific errors in console:
- CSP violations
- Script loading errors
- "Elementor not found" errors

### Manual Test
Try this in the console to test if Elementor is accessible:

```javascript
console.log({
  elementorExists: typeof elementor !== 'undefined',
  elementorVersion: elementor?.config?.version,
  $e: typeof $e !== 'undefined'
});
```

## Why This Happens

1. **CSP Restrictions**: WordPress/Elementor pages have Content Security Policy that blocks external scripts from executing in the page context
2. **Chrome Caching**: Chrome aggressively caches extension files, so changes don't apply even after clicking "reload"
3. **Context Isolation**: Extension scripts run in an isolated context and can't directly access page variables

## The Technical Solution

The fix injects minimal versions of the required classes directly as inline scripts, which bypasses CSP restrictions:

```javascript
// This code is injected directly into the page
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.textContent = `
  class ElementorEditorDetector { ... }
  class EditorContextInjector { ... }
  window.ElementorEditorDetector = ElementorEditorDetector;
  window.EditorContextInjector = EditorContextInjector;
`;
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

This works because:
- Inline scripts in dynamically created script tags CAN execute
- They run in the page context, not the extension context
- They have access to page variables like `elementor` and `$e`

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Extension completely removed and reinstalled
- [ ] All WordPress tabs closed before reinstalling
- [ ] New tab opened (not reused old tab)
- [ ] Hard refresh performed (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Console shows `[DEBUG-0]` through `[DEBUG-3]` messages
- [ ] Console shows `[Inline]` messages
- [ ] Module check shows all modules as 'function'
- [ ] In Elementor EDIT mode (not preview)
- [ ] Elementor fully loaded (no loading spinner)

## Still Having Issues?

If after following all steps the paste still doesn't work:

1. Export your console log (right-click in console → Save as...)
2. Check the manifest.json is correct
3. Verify all module files exist in chrome-extension folder
4. Try in a different browser (Edge, Brave)
5. Test on a fresh WordPress install to rule out conflicts

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Copy shows success message
- ✅ Paste (Ctrl+V) makes widget appear in editor
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ Widget is editable after pasting
- ✅ Undo/redo works with pasted elements
