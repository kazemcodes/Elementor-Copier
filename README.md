## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?
1. Make sure you're in the Elementor editor (not the frontend)
2. Refresh the page after installing the extension
3. Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### Paste not working?
1. Make sure you copied an Elementor section first
2. Try refreshing the Elementor editor page
3. Check the browser console for any errors (F12)

### Custom widgets not appearing correctly?
- This is expected! Custom widgets are converted to HTML widgets
- The visual appearance is preserved, but you won't be able to edit them as the original widget type
- Install the required plugin on the target site for full functionality
