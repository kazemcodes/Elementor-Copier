When you copy content with custom widgets (like Slider Revolution or WoodMart widgets) that don't exist on the target site, the extension automatically:

- ✅ All standard Elementor widgets
- ✅ Custom third-party widgets (converted to HTML)
- ✅ Images and media
- ✅ Styling and settings
- ✅ Responsive settings

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Content Script**: Detects Elementor and handles copy operations
- **Background Service**: Manages clipboard operations
- **Page Bridge**: Communicates with Elementor's internal API
- **Format Converter**: Converts between extension and Elementor formats
- **Paste Interceptor**: Captures paste events and injects content

### Security
- Content sanitization removes potentially harmful scripts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?
1. Make sure you're in the Elementor editor (not the frontend)
2. Refresh the page after installing the extension
3. Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
4. Reload the extension after any updates

### Copy not working?
1. Enable highlight mode: Right-click → Elementor Copier → Enable Highlight Mode
2. Make sure you're clicking on an Elementor element (sections, columns, or widgets)
3. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
4. Verify clipboard permissions are granted

### Paste not working?
1. Make sure you copied an Elementor section first
2. Verify you're in Elementor **edit mode** (not preview mode)
3. Reload the extension: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click reload
4. Refresh the Elementor editor page
5. Check browser console (F12) for initialization messages:
   - Should see: `✅ [Paste Interceptor] Paste functionality is ready!`
6. Make sure the browser window is focused when pasting

### Clipboard Issues?
1. Check browser clipboard permissions
2. Try copying again
3. Verify the data in console: `navigator.clipboard.readText().then(console.log)`
4. Should see JSON with `__ELEMENTOR_COPIER_DATA__` marker

### Custom widgets not appearing correctly?
- This is expected! Custom widgets are converted to HTML widgets
- The visual appearance is preserved, but you won't be able to edit them as the original widget type
- Install the required plugin on the target site for full functionality
