# Test Background Script Communication

## The Problem
The content script sends a message to the background script, but no response is received.

## Current Logs Show:
```
✅ [Copy] Sending copy request to background script...
✅ [Copy] Data type: section
✅ [Copy] Data size: 2049 characters
✅ [Copy] About to call chrome.runtime.sendMessage
❌ NO "[Copy] Response callback invoked"
❌ NO background script logs
```

## Possible Causes:

### 1. Background Service Worker is Inactive
Manifest V3 uses service workers that can go inactive. The message might be sent when the worker is asleep.

### 2. Message Not Reaching Background
There might be an issue with the message routing.

### 3. Background Script Has an Error
The background script might have crashed or have a syntax error.

## How to Check:

### Step 1: Check if Background Script is Running
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Elementor Copier"
3. Look for "service worker" or "Inspect views: service worker"
4. Click it to open the background script console
5. If it says "inactive", click it to wake it up

### Step 2: Test Direct Communication
Open the page console and run:
```javascript
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'test'}, (response) => {
  console.log('Test response:', response);
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.error('Error:', chrome.runtime.lastError);
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Check Background Console
After clicking a section, check the background script console for:
- `Message received in background:`
- `[Background] Received copyToClipboard request`

## Next Steps:
1. Reload the extension
2. Open background script console
3. Try copying a section
4. Share logs from BOTH consoles (page + background)
