## GitHub Actions Fix

### Problem
```
⚠️ GitHub release failed with status: 403
Error: Too many retries. Aborting...
```

### Solution
Added to `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

This grants the workflow permission to:
- Create releases
- Upload release assets
- Create tags

## Verification

### URLs Now Point To
- Repository: `https://github.com/kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier`
- Releases: `https://github.com/kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier/releases`
- Issues: `https://github.com/kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier/issues`

### Badges
- ✅ GitHub Release badge: `kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier`
- ✅ GitHub repo badge: `kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier`
- ✅ License badge: Working
- ✅ Bitcoin badge: Working

### Clone Command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kazemcodes/Elementor-Copier.git
cd Elementor-Copier
```

## Testing Checklist

Before pushing:
- [x] All URLs updated to `Elementor-Copier`
- [x] Workflow has correct permissions
- [x] Badges point to correct repository
- [x] Clone command uses correct directory name
- [ ] Repository settings allow Actions to create releases

After pushing:
- [ ] Workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Release is created automatically
- [ ] ZIP file is attached to release
- [ ] All links work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions permissions and update all repository URLs to Elementor-Copier"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Watch "Build and Release Extension" workflow
   - Should complete successfully now

3. **Verify release**:
   - Go to Releases tab
   - Should see v1.1.0 release
   - Download ZIP and test

4. **Check repository settings** (if workflow still fails):
   - Settings → Actions → General
   - Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions"
   - Save

## What Was Fixed

### Before
- ❌ Workflow had 403 error (no permissions)
- ❌ URLs pointed to old repository name
- ❌ Badge showed wrong repository
- ❌ Clone command used wrong directory

### After
- ✅ Workflow has `contents: write` permission
- ✅ All URLs point to `Elementor-Copier`
- ✅ Badges show correct repository
- ✅ Clone command uses correct directory
- ✅ Ready for automated releases

## Additional Notes

### Why 403 Error Occurred
GitHub Actions uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication. By default, this token has limited permissions. To create releases, it needs explicit `contents: write` permission.

### Why URLs Needed Updating
When you renamed the repository from `elementor-copy` to `Elementor-Copier`, all hardcoded URLs became outdated. This affected:
- User-facing links (README, documentation)
- Extension metadata (manifest.json)
- Internal links (donation buttons, help links)
- CI/CD references (workflow files)

### Case Sensitivity
GitHub repository names are case-insensitive for access but case-sensitive for display:
- `Elementor-Copier` (correct, matches repository)
- `elementor-copier` (works but inconsistent)
- `elementor-copy` (old name, redirects but should be updated)

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check [GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FIX.md](GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FIX.md) for detailed troubleshooting
2. Verify repository settings allow Actions to create releases
3. Check workflow logs in Actions tab
4. Open an issue if problems persist

---

**Status**: ✅ All URLs updated and workflow fixed
**Ready to push**: Yes
**Expected result**: Automated release creation should work now
