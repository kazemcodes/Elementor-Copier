# Test Copy Function - v1.2.2

## What's New

Added critical logging right before the clipboard copy call to see if the function is even being reached.

## How to Test

### 1. Install v1.2.2

```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Remove old version
3. Load releases/elementor-copier-v1.2.2/chrome-extension folder
4. Reload the page
```

### 2. Open Console

Press F12 to open DevTools console

### 3. Try Copying

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+C to enable highlight mode
2. Click on a section
3. Watch the console

### 4. What to Look For

**If you see:**
```
[Extract] ✓ Extraction complete
✓ Clipboard data prepared for paste-time conversion
[CopySection] About to call copyToClipboardWithRetry
[CopySection] Callback type: function
[CopySection] Clipboard data ready: true
[Copy] Sending copy request to background script...
```
✅ **Good!** The function is being called.

**If you see:**
```
[Extract] ✓ Extraction complete
✓ Clipboard data prepared for paste-time conversion
```
And then **NOTHING** ❌ **Problem!** The copyToClipboardWithRetry is never called.

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Callback Not Defined

If `[CopySection] Callback type: undefined` appears, the callback wasn't passed properly.

### Issue 2: Function Never Reached

If `[CopySection] About to call...` never appears, there's an error before that line.

### Issue 3: Silent Error

If logs stop suddenly, check for JavaScript errors in console (red text).

## Next Steps

Based on what you see, we'll know:

1. **If logs appear** → Function is called, issue is in background script
2. **If logs don't appear** → Function never called, issue is in copySection
3. **If error appears** → We'll fix that specific error

## Quick Test

Run this in console after clicking:

```javascript
// Check if callback exists
console.log('Last clicked element:', lastClickedElement);

// Try manual copy
copySection(document.querySelector('[data-element_type="section"]'), (response) => {
  console.log('Manual copy result:', response);
});
```
