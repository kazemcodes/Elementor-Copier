# ✅ Solution: Direct Clipboard API

## Problem Solved
The background service worker was unresponsive, causing clipboard operations to fail. The ping mechanism didn't work because the service worker wasn't waking up at all.

## Root Cause
Manifest V3 service workers can become completely unresponsive, and `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` callbacks are never invoked when the worker is in this state.

## Solution Implemented
**Use the Clipboard API directly from the content script**, with background script as fallback.

### Why This Works:
1. **Clipboard API is available in content scripts** - Modern browsers allow `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` in content scripts
2. **No dependency on service worker** - Works even if background script is asleep/crashed
3. **Faster** - Direct API call, no message passing overhead
4. **More reliable** - One less point of failure

### Implementation:
```javascript
// Primary method: Direct Clipboard API
navigator.clipboard.writeText(jsonString)
  .then(() => {
    // Success! Show notification
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Fallback: Try background script
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'copyToClipboard', data})
  });
```

## Expected Behavior After Reload:
1. User clicks element
2. Data extraction completes
3. `[Copy] Using direct Clipboard API`
4. `✓ Copied to clipboard via Clipboard API`
5. `[Clipboard Verify] ✓ Valid JSON`
6. Success notification appears!
7. Highlight mode disables

## Fallback Chain:
1. **Primary**: Direct Clipboard API (content script)
2. **Fallback**: Background script with offscreen document
3. **Last resort**: Error message with manual copy instructions

## Next Steps:
**Reload the extension and test!** The copy should now work immediately without any service worker issues.
