# üêõ Debug: Copy Not Working Issue

## Current Problem
Element extraction works perfectly, but the actual clipboard copy operation never happens.

## What We Know
‚úÖ Element detection works  
‚úÖ Data extraction works  
‚úÖ Media extraction works (34 items extracted)  
‚úÖ `processClipboardData` completes  
‚ùå Clipboard write never happens  
‚ùå No success notification appears  

## Debug Logs Added

I've added comprehensive logging throughout the copy flow:

### 1. Click Handler (line ~1732)
```
[Click] Calling copySection for element type: section
```

### 2. copySection Function Start (line ~810)
```
[CopySection] Function called, element: <element>, callback: function
[CopySection] Section element found: true
```

### 3. Data Extraction (line ~828)
```
[CopySection] Data extracted: true
```

### 4. Media Extraction (line ~850)
```
[CopySection] About to extract media URLs
[CopySection] Media extracted, count: 34
```

### 5. Process Clipboard Data (line ~865)
```
[CopySection] Before processClipboardData
[CopySection] After processClipboardData, data exists: true
```

### 6. Before Copy (line ~869)
```
[CopySection] About to call copyToClipboardWithRetry
[CopySection] Callback type: function
[CopySection] Clipboard data ready: true
```

### 7. Clipboard Write (line ~1403)
```
[Copy] Sending copy request to background script...
[Copy] Data type: section
[Copy] Data size: 12345 characters
```

### 8. Error Handling (line ~875)
```
[CopySection] CAUGHT ERROR: <error>
[CopySection] Error stack: <stack>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. **Refresh the test page**
3. **Click a section** in highlight mode
4. **Check console logs** - they will show exactly where the code stops

## Expected Log Flow

If everything works, you should see:
```
[Click] Element clicked: section
[Click] Calling copySection for element type: section
[CopySection] Function called
[CopySection] Section element found: true
[CopySection] Data extracted: true
[Extract] ========== EXTRACTING ELEMENT DATA ==========
... (extraction logs) ...
[CopySection] About to extract media URLs
Extracted 34 media items from element
[CopySection] Media extracted, count: 34
[CopySection] Before processClipboardData
‚úì Clipboard data prepared for paste-time conversion
[CopySection] After processClipboardData, data exists: true
[CopySection] About to call copyToClipboardWithRetry
[CopySection] Callback type: function
[CopySection] Clipboard data ready: true
[Copy] Sending copy request to background script...
[Copy] Data type: section
[Copy] Data size: XXXXX characters
[Copy] Received response from background: {success: true}
‚úì Copied to clipboard
```

## Possible Issues

### If logs stop at "Before processClipboardData"
‚Üí Issue in `processClipboardData` function

### If logs stop at "After processClipboardData"
‚Üí Issue between processing and calling `copyToClipboardWithRetry`

### If logs stop at "About to call copyToClipboardWithRetry"
‚Üí Issue in `copyToClipboardWithRetry` function itself

### If you see "[CopySection] CAUGHT ERROR"
‚Üí An exception was thrown, check the error message

### If no [CopySection] logs appear at all
‚Üí The function isn't being called (check if old code is still running)
