# Paste Functionality Fix

## Problem
The paste functionality was not working because the `PasteInterceptor` module was not being initialized, even though the code existed.

## Root Cause
1. `paste-interceptor.js` was listed in `web_accessible_resources` but not loaded as a content script
2. `clipboard-manager.js` was not included in the manifest
3. No initialization code was present to set up the paste interceptor

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `manifest.json`
Added `clipboard-manager.js` and `paste-interceptor.js` to the MAIN world content scripts:

```json
{
  "matches": ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"],
  "js": [
    "content-sanitizer.js",
    "elementor-format-converter.js",
    "elementor-editor-detector.js",
    "editor-injector.js",
    "page-bridge.js",
    "clipboard-manager.js",
    "paste-interceptor.js"
  ],
  "run_at": "document_start",
  "world": "MAIN",
  "all_frames": false
}
```

### 2. Added Auto-Initialization to `paste-interceptor.js`
Added code at the end of `paste-interceptor.js` to automatically initialize when in Elementor editor:

- Detects if page is in Elementor editor
- Initializes required modules (ClipboardManager, EditorContextInjector)
- Sets up paste event listeners
- Logs success messages to console

## How It Works Now

1. **Extension loads** on any webpage
2. **Paste interceptor checks** if it's in Elementor editor
3. **If in editor**, initializes all required modules:
   - ClipboardManager (reads/writes clipboard)
   - EditorContextInjector (injects into Elementor)
   - ElementorFormatConverter (converts formats)
4. **Attaches keyboard listeners** for Ctrl+V / Cmd+V
5. **On paste**:
   - Checks if clipboard contains extension data
   - If yes, prevents default paste
   - Converts data to Elementor format
   - Injects into Elementor editor
   - Shows success notification

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Elementor Copier"
3. Click the reload button

### 2. Test Copy
1. Go to an Elementor page (frontend)
2. Right-click on a section
3. Select "Elementor Copier" > "Copy Section"
4. You should see "Section copied successfully!" notification

### 3. Test Paste
1. Go to Elementor editor (edit mode)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these messages:
   ```
   [Paste Interceptor] In Elementor editor, initializing paste functionality...
   ✅ [Paste Interceptor] Paste functionality is ready!
   ✅ [Paste Interceptor] You can now paste copied Elementor elements with Ctrl+V / Cmd+V
   ```
4. Click somewhere in the editor
5. Press Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V on Mac)
6. You should see:
   ```
   [Paste Interceptor] ✓ Paste shortcut detected!
   [Paste Interceptor] Triggering extension paste with data...
   ✓ Paste injection successful
   ```
7. The section should appear in your editor

## Expected Console Output

### On Editor Page Load:
```
[Paste Interceptor] Auto-initialization starting...
[Paste Interceptor] In Elementor editor, initializing paste functionality...
[Paste Interceptor] Initializing in Elementor editor...
[Paste Interceptor] Attaching keyboard listeners...
✓ Keyboard paste listeners attached
✓ Paste interceptor initialized
✅ [Paste Interceptor] Paste functionality is ready!
```

### On Paste (Ctrl+V):
```
[Paste Interceptor] Key event: {key: "v", ctrlKey: true, ...}
[Paste Interceptor] ✓ Paste shortcut detected!
[ClipboardManager] Read clipboard, length: 2543
[ClipboardManager] ✓ JSON parsed successfully
✓ Paste event intercepted, extension data detected
[Paste Interceptor] Triggering extension paste with data...
[Paste Interceptor] ========== INJECTING INTO ELEMENTOR ==========
✓ Paste injection successful via method: clipboard
✓ Elements created: 1
Section pasted successfully!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Paste Not Working
1. **Check console for initialization messages**
   - If you don't see "Paste functionality is ready!", the interceptor didn't initialize
   - Check for error messages

2. **Verify you're in Elementor editor**
   - Paste only works in edit mode, not preview mode
   - URL should contain `/wp-admin/post.php?post=...&action=elementor`

3. **Check clipboard data**
   - In console, run: `navigator.clipboard.readText().then(console.log)`
   - Should see JSON with `__ELEMENTOR_COPIER_DATA__` marker

4. **Verify modules loaded**
   - In console, check:
     ```javascript
     console.log(window.ClipboardManager);
     console.log(window.EditorContextInjector);
     console.log(window.elementorCopierPasteInterceptor);
     ```
   - All should be defined

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "ClipboardManager not available"
- **Solution**: Reload the extension, the module didn't load

**Issue**: "EditorContextInjector not available"  
- **Solution**: Reload the extension and refresh the page

**Issue**: "No extension data in clipboard"
- **Solution**: Copy an element first using the extension

**Issue**: Paste works but element doesn't appear
- **Solution**: Check Elementor console for errors, may be a version compatibility issue

## Files Modified

1. `chrome-extension/manifest.json` - Added clipboard-manager.js and paste-interceptor.js to content scripts
2. `chrome-extension/paste-interceptor.js` - Added auto-initialization code at the end

## Next Steps

After reloading the extension:
1. Test copying a section from a frontend page
2. Test pasting into Elementor editor
3. Verify the section appears correctly
4. Test with different element types (widgets, columns)
